# python-malware-scanner
A simple Python application that scans files for malware

## Hello!
This was one of my projects after starting to learn Python. It's a dictionary-based malware scanner.

## How it works:
You select a file to scan and the program takes the md5 hash of said file and compares it to other entries in its dictionary. If it matches one of the hashes, it'll indicate that the file is dangerous.

## How to update the dictionary:
This program is reliant on this website: https://virusshare.com/ for the hashes determining whether or not a file is a virus. To add a list of hashes to the dictionary, simply download one of the text files and the program should automatically include and delete any duplicate hashes in its dictionary.

I hope you enjoy:)
